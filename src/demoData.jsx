    {"summary":"he G20 Summit has brought the concept of environmental justice to the forefront. The international focus on the environment began formally in 1972 at the Stockholm Conference, but disagreements on who should bear the costs of protecting the environment emerged. Developed countries blamed population growth in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for ecological problems, while developing countries argued that historical imperialism and industrialization were key factors and that technology and finance should be shared. In 1992, the UN Environment Conference in Rio de Janeiro highlighted concerns about global warming, but divisions persisted, particularly regarding economic growth as a solution. Climate justice now encompasses both developing and industrialized economies and recognizes the different relationships nations have with the post-World War II world order. It emphasizes the need for shared concerns, including costs, technology, and choices about livelihoods and lifestyles. Climate justice also involves giving marginalized groups, such as indigenous peoples and women, a voice in decision-making processes. Ensuring their rights and accommodating their practices is crucial. The conversation on climate justice also extends to the well-being of other species and the importance of keeping landscapes habitable for them. Cooperative discussions like the G20 can play a role in including the well-being of other species in future plans. The future must consider the long lifespans of certain species, such as the Atlantic bowhead whale, and the communities that rely on them. Other countries can contribute to creating a future that includes both these species and native peoples. The well-being of other species is intertwined with human well-being, and it is essential to consider justice in environmental decision-making processes.","button":"a"}
